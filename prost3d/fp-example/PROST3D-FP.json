In the scop40 benchmark PROST3D finds d2giaa1 as homolog to b.55.1.1 familiy for 36 cases. In the CATH database these two protein belongs to same superfamily.1v61A00 has 100% sequence identity to d1v61a_ and classifed as 2.30.29.30 and 2giaA00 has 92.7% sequence identity to d2giaa1 and classifed as 2.30.31.40. When the two scop domain is aligned with FATCAT a significant alignment with  a P-value of 1.43e-02 is found."
